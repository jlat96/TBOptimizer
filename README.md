## Introduction

TrailBlazer is a local search/optimization artificial intelligence library for .NET. Our goal is to provide users with a simple, powerful and expandable suite of optimization tools to easily implement local search into applications. The core foundation of TrailBlazer is a generic framework so that applications of any scope can make use of efficient tools without each project requiring a complex independent implementation.
